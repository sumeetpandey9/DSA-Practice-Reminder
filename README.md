A Chrome extension to remind you to stay on track with your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice. It helps you stay motivated, with options to mark tasks as done, snooze reminders, or track your progress for the day.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Mark tasks as done or snooze them for later.

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing the extension files.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed:
- A reminder will pop up asking if you’ve completed your DSA practice for the day.
- Click **Yes, I did it!** to dismiss the reminder.
- Click **Snooze** to dismiss temporarily and receive the reminder again later.
- Click **I’m solving now!** to acknowledge you’re working on it.
- Optionally, select **Don’t show again today** to skip the reminder for the rest of the day.
